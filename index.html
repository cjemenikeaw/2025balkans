        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Follow along with me on my travels through several Balkan states in April 2025. The exact geographical boundaries of this region 
            are up for debate, but the cities I visited are generally considered to be part of 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans#/map/0" target="_blank">the region</a>.

            <p>If you're here for pictures, head to one of the other tabs. If you're here for lukewarm post-trip takes, keep reading.</p>
            <h2>We all have our own problems</h2>
                <p>Going into this trip, I was worried about how US travelers would be received given the number of unforced errors the US government 
                is threatening to inflict on the global economy, but I needn't have worried - I only talked about US politics with other tourists (and 
                my very online Belgrade Airbnb host). This is unsurprising in retrospect, but locals may not be paying as close attention to the 
                situation in the US because they have their hands full dealing with their own struggles.
                </p>

            <h2>Major issues facing this region</h2>
                <p>On that note, during this trip I realized there are some common pain points in the countries I visited, including: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Land disputes and disagreements with neighboring countries, like 
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia%E2%80%93Turkey_relations" target="_blank">this</a> and 
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo%E2%80%93Serbia_relations" target="_blank">this</a> (and even 
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_naming_dispute" target="_blank">this</a> for a while until it was 
                            resolved in 2018)
                        </li>
                        <li>Unaccounted-for government spending that contributed to a declining economy - 
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunkers_in_Albania" target="_blank">this</a> and 
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolmabah%C3%A7e_Palace" target="_blank">this</a> come to mind
                        </li>
                        <li>Accusations of government corruption in various forms - 
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_of_Ekrem_%C4%B0mamo%C4%9Flu" target="_blank">this</a> and 
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novi_Sad_railway_station_canopy_collapse" target="_blank">this</a> in particular 
                            were hot-button topics that generated significant levels of outrage and public protest at the time (I didn't hear about 
                            <a href="https://albaniavisit.com/tourism-politics/erion-veliaj-corruption-tirana-albania/" target="_blank">this</a>  
                            at the time, but it seems like a big deal as well)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>One of the biggest issues in the Balkans right now is 
                <a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/09/16/brain-drain-in-western-balkans-spikes-amid-absence-of-opportunities" 
                    target="_blank">brain drain</a>, both domestically (citizens migrating from rural areas to major cities) and 
                internationally (citizens relocating to other European countries in search higher pay and more opportunities). 
                Young people (under 35) and professionals (nurses, software developers, etc.) in particular are leaving in droves due to 
                an overt lack of meritocracy in the workforce. It's sad to see given the region has so much to offer regarding culture, food, 
                and tourism opportunities.
                </p>

                <p>Not to say things are much better where I live - this is more commentary on some of the common struggles faced by people all 
                over the world today, along with worldwide demands for governments to do better by and for their citizens.
                </p>

            <h2>1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 (but 1 ≠ 1)</h2>
                <p> There are a lot of commonalities in the Balkans, especially linguistically. Many countries use the Cyrillic writing system — 
                for anyone who speaks Russian, local Slavic greetings will sound very familiar. See/listen for yourself:
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Excuse me" in Russian: <a href="https://youtu.be/HJ2edb0PdEY?t=37" target="_blank">Извините</a></li>
                        <li>"Excuse me" in Bulgarian: <a href="https://youtu.be/BKcg2M32x54?t=120" target="_blank">Извинете</a></li>
                        <li>"Excuse me" in Serbian: <a href="https://youtu.be/hZud9EoEI24?t=286" target="_blank">Извините</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>Albanian is a notable exception (the language is very different from its neighbors - one tour guide said it's "because they 
                    live in the mountains"), but in general most Slavic languages are at least somewhat mutually intelligible. I also didn't 
                    notice much physical difference between different ethnic groups (though I'm told Montenegrins are noticeably taller than 
                    other Balkan citizens). 
                </p>

                <caption>Yugoslavia was made up of seven constituent countries (or six, depending on who you ask).</caption>

            <p> All that to say, it's interesting how, even among populations with a lot in common ethnically or culturally, humans always 
                come up with a way to construct a social hierarchy among them (often through nationalism in the case of Yugoslavia). These 
                kind of groupings can serve as a way to acknowledge the shared humanity and experiences of a certain subset of people, but 
                they can also be manipulated to drive a wedge between different groups.
            </p>

            <h2>Would I visit again?</h2>
            <p> Hard to say — I had a wonderful time, but things could look very different in the future as demographics and opportunities shift. 
                Each experience is inherently ephemeral due to its unique place in time (e.g., there will only be one April 2025), and certain 
                aspect of my trip may not be repeatable in the future, especially if the levels of brain drain and government corruption remain 
                unchecked (though I'm in no position to throw stones since things aren't great here either). 
            </p>
            <p>I'll be keeping an eye on regional politics and rooting for empowered citizens who demand change for the better, 
                both in the Balkans and at home.
            </p>

        <p style="text-align: end;">*These are my general thoughts based on several one-off tours - they are in no way meant to accurately 
        represent the history of communism and Yugoslavia. Take these casual opinions with several grains of salt and do your own research.
