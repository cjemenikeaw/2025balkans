        <h1>Communism Crash Course</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Communism is still relatively close in the rearview mirror for this part of the world - on this trip I got 
            some insight into how it worked in different countries, as well as different styles of government (the benefits and shortcomings).
        </p>

                <h2>Bulgaria</h2>
                <p>The communist period in Bulgaria (1944-1989) was a polarizing time - people either loved or hated it (generally depending on 
                    how they and their family were personally impacted). Communism did offer several significant benefits - literacy rates 
                    skyrocketed, the state guaranteed employment and housing, and the government enforced wage equality for men and women 
                    (i.e., equal pay for equal work). On the other hand, whether you were happy with your job and where you lived was 
                    inconsequential, and while you had what you needed, it could be reallocated at any time to suit the needs of the state 
                    (as in, imagine being told one day that you can no longer enter a section of your home because it's been assigned to 
                    another family).

                    given it wasn't really yours).
                </caption>
                <br>
                <p>Generally, faith in or knowledge of anything outside of the state (religion, international affairs, etc.) was highly discouraged. 
                    To that end, many places of worship were destroyed during the communism era, and worshippers were forced to practice in secret. 
                    There was one (state-run) news channel, and media was heavily controlled - as an example, Bulgarians weren't informed about the 
                    Chernobyl disaster and resulting fallout until 
                    <a href="https://theconversation.com/chernobyl-we-lived-through-its-consequences-holidays-in-the-fallout-zone-shouldnt-be-a-picnic-118709" target="_blank">

                <h2>Albania</h2>
                <p>Communism in Albania was brutal - the country was under the control of dictator 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enver_Hoxha" target="_blank">Enver Hoxha</a>, 
                    who isolated citizens both geographically (Albanians were forbidden from leaving, and there was an electric fence around the 
                    border to enforce that) and mentally (people were encouraged to report on their neighbors for basically any reason, which 
                    created a low-trust environment). To this day there's still a strong distrust of government, though that's likely more to do with 
                    <a href="https://www.ocnal.com/2025/02/albanias-political-corruption-fight.html" target="_blank">recent corruption allegations</a>

                <p>While Albanians were standing in ration lines, Hoxha was spending the country's money on bunkers to "protect from the enemy" 
                    (largely a fabrication of his paranoia). Many of these were never used, but some have since been repurposed into museums, 
                    wine cellars, and even bat caves.

                <p>The Museum of Yugoslav History in Belgrade pays homage to the fact that Belgrade was the seat of Yugoslavia's government. 
                    While there we did a deep dive into 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josip_Broz_Tito" target="_blank">Josip Broz Tito</a>,

                    hear the not-so-nice part before we got in. If anyone happened to be listening in, the fountain helped drown out our guide's 
                    voice.

                <p>Apparently Tito was a larger-than-life figure - charismatic and with a masculine air to him. He was also quite popular 
                    internationally, considering the number of gifts and awards he received from foreign leaders during his tenure. His death 
                    in 1980 triggered a seven-day national mourning period and the beginning of the end for Yugoslavia - he was able to keep 
                    the nationalist tensions at a simmer, but when he died left behind big shoes to fill, and while several tried to be 
                    "Tito after Tito", ultimately none were successful.

                <br>
                <p> After Tito's death, more information about the (poor) state of Yugoslavia became public. During this trip I learned there were 
                    also 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasenovac_concentration_camp" target="_blank">concentration camps</a>
                    in Yugoslavia - similar to Albania, citizens would report on each other (apparently just suggesting that someone was 
                    "for Stalin" would suffice) and be disappeared in mass numbers, never to be seen again. I hadn't heard about this before, but it seems like 
                    a sensitive issue - my tour guide compared this to the 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre" target="_blank">Srebrenica massacre</a> 
                    (a major impetus for NATO involvement in the Bosnian War), which he acknowledged was a war crime but stopped short of calling  
                    a genocide. He seemed frustrated that the labor camps (i.e., the time Serbians were the main victims) aren't as well-known 
                    and don't spur as much sympathy.

                <p>In the end, opinions on communism largely seem to depend on you or your family's experience with it, who you learned
                    your history from and any biases they may hold, and how strong your nationalist tendencies are. 
                    There have been attempts to either rewrite history to make events more palatable for a given audience, delete or remove reminders 
                    of that time (because they were considered too traumatic), or ignore it altogether. It's a hard balance - it's important to 
                    acknowledge and remember the past, but equally as important to let people move forward from painful memories.

                <h2>What have we learned?*</h2>
                <p> Something I've been thinking a lot about since I came back is how people interacted with each other during the communism era (aside from 
                    the state-sanctioned spying and citizen policing). I'm mainly thinking in terms of if/how one could satisfy humanity's innate need 
                    for self-actualization, establish a sense of self, or gain some level of standing in their community, given the forced equality of 
                    communism. Essentially, my thesis question is:
                </p>
                <caption>What can I do to earn regard from the people around me?</caption>
                <br>
                <p> In the US, today's society would have us believe the answer to this question is "have a lot of money" or "own nice things". 
                    I don't think either of those are the right answer, but even if they were, that wouldn't have been feasible in a communist system 
                    given the state determined where you lived, what job you had and how much you were paid, etc. 
                </p>
                <p>I also wonder how much state interference impacted one's life goals and pursuits. State-sponsored activities were likely on the path 
                    of least resistance logistically, and you might receive a certain level of prestige for completing them, but that's not the same 
                    as doing something because you want to. Similarly, how much of the external validation one received from their community be 
                    trusted? Are people telling you what they genuinely think, or are they regurgitating the state-sanctioned opinion about that 
                    activity? The latter is certainly the safer option, especially in the context of a society where one could be whisked away to 
                    a labor camp based on a single rumor...more research needed.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>In short, I'm hardly an expert on communism now, but this trip was a great primer and has given me a lot to think about.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p style="text-align: end;">*These are my general thoughts based on several one-off tours - they are in no way meant to accurately 
            represent the history of communism and Yugoslavia. Take these casual opinions with several grains of salt and do your own research.
